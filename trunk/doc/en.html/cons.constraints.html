>&#13;				Project will work in networked environment, in client-server
				achitecture. Usually users will use available resources 
				using some network applications like: e-mail client, 
				network browser, FTP client, etc.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				To support the largest group of users (assuming that software
				used by them work properly) with services available in the
				system all services must comply with common standards or
				regulations. System should be tested with most popular
				applications like: Firefox, Internet Explorer, Thunderbird,
				Outlook Express, Outlook, Opera, The Bat. From time to time
				it should be also tested with some less popular applications.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Very important is a security of the system - global or 
				service based; high availability. Because one of the
				target environments are systems accessible for any one
				it must be ensured that system can handle malicious users
				or network worms, etc. Architecture and procedures used
				in the system must be created with security in mind.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Because system is create as a open source software
				without sponsors or other income sources all additional actions
				must be cut to the minimum. Same time it must be remembered
				that testing is not one of those actions. Unit and integration
				testing are very important in keeping good quality of the
				product which is very important. Only product of good
				quality will have a chance to exist in the market.
				That's why testing should be done at the same
				time as the development or even before it as test driven
				development says.
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Quality of documentation is also very important.
				It can not be accepted that system is extended without
				documentation being updated. All modification should
				be documented upwards than implemented. This way
				it will be easier to keep documentation up to date -
				documentation created after implementation is usually
				worse than documentation created before it. Two
				language version are maintained at the same time - Polish
				and English. Comments in code are made only in English.
