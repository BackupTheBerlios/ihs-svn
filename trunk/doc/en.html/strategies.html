><P
>&#13;					First of supported operating systems is Linux. It was decided because
					it's one of the most popular systems used on servers.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Only 2 of hundreds of existsing distributions are supported: 
					Fedora Core (free version that Red Hat Enterprise Linux is based on) 
					and OpenSuSe (free version that SuSe Linux Enterprise Server is based on). 
					They are similar so it's easy to support them at the same time.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Both distributions are based on RPM package manager, thanks to that it's 
					easy to create installation version. It's also easy to manage
					installed software, enhances to try product (because it's easy to remove it).
					Dependencies are easily tracked, also updates are easy to perform.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					In future IHS will be ported to other Unix operating systems. Windows
					won't be probably officially supported.

NAME="strategies.products.databases"
>4.2.1.2. PostgreSQL, Oracle</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;					As every complex system IHS requires database for it's operations. 
					Database is used as a storage for configuration, users and every other data
					that must be kept for a long time.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					In first version two different database systems are used, this way it's possible
					to select the most suitable one. Oracle is a lider in corporate environments. PostgreSQL
					is a lider of open source databases.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Both systems are similar in basic functionality - they support views, procedures stored in server,
					triggers. Mentioned feautes were used during implementation. That's way MySQL - the most popular
					open source databases is at this time not supported - it doesn't have required features.
					MySQL support would require architecture changes.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Selection of those databases systems was also dictated by Virtual Qmail - it supports
					at this time only Oracle and PostgreSQL. Because Virtual Qmail is intergral part of IHS
					supported by it databases should be also supported by IHS. This way it's easier to integrate both
					systems.

>&#13;					Virtual Qmail is core of the system - this application is responsible for managing mail system.
					It's responsible for registering or removing users or domains. With MTA it creates mail system which is easy
					in maitenance.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					IHS is another user interface which can be used to manage Virtual Qmail. There are some other application
					that do job similar to Virtual Qmail. Selection was based on previous experience, see NIE-2002.

>&#13;					Virtual Qmail consists of separate services that communicatie with each other, adding additional services
					used in IHS is easy. It's also possible to easily integrate parts written in different languages.

></H3
><P
>&#13;					Java was selected because it's very popular in web world.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Other possibilities were C++, PERL, PHP or python. But following disadvantages were against them:
					<P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>&#13;								C++ - lack of support for creating web services, longest time to market, there's less libraries similar to J2EE ones;
							</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;								PERL - lack of support for complex object oriented systems, there's no similar environment to J2EE;
							</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;								PHP - lack of support for CORBA;
							</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;								python - less popular than J2EE, time needed to learn language, Zope is not as good as J2EE;
							</P
></LI
></UL
><P>
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Java compared to other languages brings environment in which it's easy to create applications, it has great background - J2EE gives
					you lot of libraries and mechanisms, also there's plenty of experienced users willing to share their knowledge.
					It supports CORBA out of the box, JDBC gives easy to use interface for databases.

NAME="strategies.products.jsf"
>4.2.1.6. Java Server Faces</A
></H3
><P
>&#13;					To make implementation of IHS easy decision was made to use framework called Java Server Faces. It's an additional
					layer between that brings object oriented wrappers for standard HTML elements, also additional elements are available.
					This makes easy to create and integrate JSP with business logic.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Unfortunately during implementation based on JSF there were many problems which delayed project.
					Current experience says JSF may not be best option available, some mechanisms are missing, probably it would have
					been better decision to use Struts.

					by low price (it's free), good documenation, large users group and good support.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					Also it's easy to install, performs well and have all functions required to implement this project.
				</P
><P
>&#13;					In future other J2EE servers will also be supported. But at this time system was tested only with Tomcat.
