Welcome to Incredible Hosting System.
My name is Pawel Niewiadomski and I'm proud to present you my work.
Program you've downloaded is supposed to be used as a web interface
for Virtual Qmail.

I hope you will enjoy using it. If you encounter any problems with
installation, administration please contact me. If you have
any questions you can ask them on project's mailing list or
forums at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ihs, you can also contact me directly - 
- new@foo-baz.com.

More documentation is in doc/en.html directory. There you will find
informations about current (and future) features, installation
procedure, and more.

The most current version of documentation, forums, mailing lists and
releases can be found at http://ihs.foo-baz.com (mirror at
http://ihs.sourceforge.net).

Help me build a better software!
