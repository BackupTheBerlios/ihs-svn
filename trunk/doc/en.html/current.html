>&#13;			Because thesis subject is a modernization of existing system
			current system should be described first. System was created
			as a bachelor thesis of Pawe³ Niewiadomski, subject was 
			"Free e-mail hosting". During that project software was 
			created that offered users basic functionality of such system. 
		</P
><P
>&#13;			Users were able to create, remove and configure basic 
			options throught <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>WWW</I
> pages.
			Options offered were comparable to other similar systems,
			ie. it was possible to setup mail redirection, automatic
			responses. Access to e-mails stored within server
			was possible througth standard <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>POP3</I
> protocol
			and WWW site.
		</P
><P
>&#13;			Administrator was able, throught WWW, to see basic
			statistics, to modify existing accounts. Project didn't
			include advanced configuration options for administrators. Main 
			aim was to create system that users were able to use.
			This way system created could be maintained only by
			experienced administrators.
		</P
><P
>&#13;			On a base of e-mail system there was designed and created 
			hosting system with additional functions as managing
			users' WWW sites, configuration of those sites via WWW.
			Users gained also an ability to see statistics of their
			own sites registered within system. There was still lack
			of tools for administrators. Some options were not implemented
			because of short time and costs reduction.

			Main application was written mainly in C++, some parts also
			in PHP and PERL, shell scripts. For full description

>&#13;			One of major drawbacks of created system was that it was
			only a single setup, it was not flexible enough.
			to support different needs of administrators. Installation
			process was really hard. That's why main goal of this 
			thesis is a modernization of existing system to comply with
			following requirements. Some requirements are already
			implemented, they are marked.
