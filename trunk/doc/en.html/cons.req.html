>&#13;		Because thesis subject is a modernization of existing system
		cons.req system should be described first. System was created
		as a bachelor thesis of Pawe³ Niewiadomski, subject was 
		"Free e-mail hosting". During that project software was 
		created that offered users basic functionality of such system. 
	</P
><P
>&#13;		Users were able to create, remove and configure basic 
		options throught <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>WWW</I
> pages.
		Options offered were comparable to other similar systems,
		ie. it was possible to setup mail redirection, automatic
		responses. Access to e-mails stored within server
		was possible througth standard <I
CLASS="glossterm"
>POP3</I
> protocol
		and WWW site.
	</P
><P
>&#13;		Administrator was able, throught WWW, to see basic
		statistics, to modify existing accounts. Project didn't
		include advanced configuration options for administrators. Main 
		aim was to create system that users were able to use.
		This way system created could be maintained only by
		experienced administrators.
	</P
><P
>&#13;		On a base of e-mail system there was designed and created 
		hosting system with additional functions as managing
		users' WWW sites, configuration of those sites via WWW.
		Users gained also an ability to see statistics of their
		own sites registered within system. There was still lack
		of tools for administrators. Some options were not implemented
		because of short time and costs reduction.

		Main application was written mainly in C++, some parts also
		in PHP and PERL, shell scripts. For full description 
		see NIE-2002.
	</P
><P
>&#13;		One of major drawbacks of created system was that it was
		only a single setup, it was not flexible enough.
		to support different needs of administrators. Installation
		process was really hard. That's why main goal of this 
		thesis is a modernization of existing system to comply with
		following requirements. Some requirements are already
		implemented, they are marked.
