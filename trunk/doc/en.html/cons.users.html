							offered services (turning on, turning off, etc.),
							IT knowledge is not required from them;
							privileges extended by basic administration
							of assiociated domains;
						</P

><LI
><P
>&#13;							system administrators - they have 
							the knowledge about the environment in which
							IHS runs, they know how to install or configure
							whole applications in this environment, they
							should have knowledge about software used by
							IHS (installation and configuration of
							required applications), they have basic
							knowledge of IHS; they have unlimited
							privileges;
						</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;							developers - they have knowledge
							about services offered by IHS, they
							are familiar with sytem's architecture,
							used database systems, configuration,
							communication protocols, available API;
							informations like operating system running
							IHS, used software should be meaningless for
							they; they are not direct users of the system;
						</P
></LI
></UL
><P>
			</P
><P
>&#13;				Each of described groups must be dynamically 
				recognized. One IHS installation must be able to
				service functions for any member of any group; 
				users and groups are recognized using informations stored
				in the system and those given by the user. There
				should be a possibility to limit access to installation
				only to some groups.
